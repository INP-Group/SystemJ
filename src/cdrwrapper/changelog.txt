 hack fo Dima's naming problem: converting ic. --> ic.x. in wrapper

[0.5]

 - added multiply registration of the same channel (and bigc)
   first registration - channel registered with C-lib
   next registration - python adding callback and returns the same handle
   callback that passed to SimpleAccess C API - auto created and calls all user callbacks
   user callbacks are stored and called from python side (it's now must be python callable)

 - ByteSegmentsArray moved to separate file.
   this class makes possible to work with Bigc out of the box.
   It's not even tested

 - auto-translator for callbacks to C-functions is not removed yet
   but it's not needed any more

[0.3]

 - renamed class and methods to make API more readable

 - added auto-translation callbacks to C-functions
   user can give C or python function

[0.2]

 - added ByteSegmentsArray

 - tested Bigc work with numpy arrays (numpy ctypes interface)

[0.1]

 - the first wrapper for cdr's SimpleAccess (cx control system client library)

 - tested with regular channels
