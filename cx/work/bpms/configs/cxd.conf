#
#  cxd.conf
#      Configuration file for CX daemon (cxd)
#
#  Format:
#      Lines, starting with hashes ('#') and blank lines are ignored
#      (hashes after non-whitespaces are not allowed yet).
#      Case of letters is NOT sensitive, except in file names.
#      Multiple tabs and spaces are treated as a single whitespace
#      character (unless noted otherwise).
#
#      It consists of a number of sections, each configuring some
#      of the daemon subsystems. Each section looks like:
#
#          .section <section-name> {
#            <section-contents>
#          }
#
#      Possible section names are "environment", "logging" and "access".
#
#      See the comments before sections for description of individual
#      section formats.
#


#
#  Environment
#      Environment variables.
#
#  Format:
#      <variable-name> = <variable-contents>
#
#      Spaces and tabs in the <variable-contents> are preserved, but are
#      ignored before first non-whitespace character after '='.
#      Variable names are converted to uppercase automatically.
#

#
#  Logging
#      List of logfiles
#

#      to the same file.
#      Use /dev/null as file-name to disable logging of some
#      category(ies).
